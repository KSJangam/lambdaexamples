Python application showcasing the use of lambda expressions alongside map, filter, and reduce functions.

The user is prompted to input a sentence, which wil be used to calculate the following:

1. Largest word in the sentence: a reduce function was used with a lambda expression in order to find the largest word of the sentence.

2. Smallest word in the sentence: a reduce function was used with a lambda expression in order to find the smallest word of the sentence.

3. Total number of characters: reduce and map functions were used with lambda expressions. The map function was nested inside the reduce function. This expression calculated the total number of characters in the sentence.

4. upper_case_vowels: A series of reduce and map functions were used with lamda expressions to print the sentence with vowels capitalized and consonants in the lower case.

5. pig latin message: a function was written to convert words into pig latin. The function was used in a lambda expression to map the words of the sentence to their pig latin form, and a reduce function was used with a lambda expression to collect all the words back into a sentence.

6. small_words: a filter function was used with a lambda expression to print a list of all the words of the sentence that were three characters long or shorter.

7. reverse_a: a filter function nested in a map function was used with lambda expressions in order to list all words that contained the letter a, backwards.

8. number_of_vowels: a filter function, nested in a map function, nested in a reduce function was used with lambda expressions to calculate the number of vowels in the sentence.
